Description: Fast annotation of genomic peaks using DNA interaction data by constructing interaction networks with igraph, where peaks overlapping any node in a connected subgraph are annotated with all genes in that subgraph.
    The annotation evidence could be visualized as either a network graph or a genomic track integrated with gene annotation information.
